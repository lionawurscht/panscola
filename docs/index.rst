   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Panscola's documentation!
====================================

Panscola is a collection of pandoc filters I created using `panflute <http://scorreia.com/software/panflute/>`_ while writing my thesis. In the end I ended up programming more then I wrote.
Maybe some of these are useful for someone else. I created these docs just to try out actually documenting my code a bit.
